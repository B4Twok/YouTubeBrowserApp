**[Download v1.1.2 Release](https://github.com/rkttu/YouTubeBrowserApp/releases/tag/1.1.2)**

This app is a separate app that only plays YouTube videos, regardless of the behavior of your web browser. It helps you to watch both your web browser and YouTube video at the same time.

This app is inspired by DeskApp for YouTube (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deskapp-for-youtube/id1180531112).

## New Features (v1.1.3)

* Updated to use WebView2 based on Microsoft Edge.

## What you need to run the program

* In Windows 10 or later, you can run it immediately without installing the program separately. (Windows 10 is recommended.)
* On Windows 10 and below, the [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48) is required. And [Microsofte Edge WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) is required.
* This app does not support offline mode, so you should have an internet connection.

## How to use

Open this app, sign in to YouTube, and play your favorite music.

If you know the video ID, you can play the video quickly by typing the following command line:

```
youtube-app.exe <Your Video ID>
```

Also, if you minimize the window, the window will be displayed as a tray icon, so you can make the taskbar neat.

## Localization

Currently, this program supports `Korean (Korea)` and `English` as display languages. I welcome your participation in multilingual translation.
